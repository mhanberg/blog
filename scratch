- [ ] Intro
    - Shell is hard to understand, but learning the basics can go a long way
    - Lets learn how the prompt, aliases, completions, and plugins work
- [ ] The Prompt
    - Essentially a fancy format string
    - Parameter expansion ${}
    - Can run arbitrary code during prompt expansion
    - There are hooks to run before the prompt is expanded
    - [ ] VCS
- [ ] Aliases/Functions
    - aliases are shortcuts for other commands
    - functions can act as aliases, but can take arguments and be multi line
- [ ] Tab Completions
    - You have to manually load completions
    - tools define their own completions and are installed
    - Homebrew will install these for you
- [ ] Plugins
