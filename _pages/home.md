# Lead Software Engineer

My name is Mitchell Hanberg and I am a lead software engineer from Indianapolis, IN.

Lately I've been building backend distributed systems and Elixir developer tooling.

I am a member of the [Elixir Language Server team](https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2024/08/15/welcome-elixir-language-server-team/), the leader and author of the [elixir-tools](https://github.com/elixir-tools) family of developer tools, the maintainer of [Wallaby](https://www.github.com/elixir-wallaby/wallaby), and the author of [Temple](https://www.github.com/mhanberg/temple).

## Projects

### elixir-tools

[elixir-tools](https://github.com/elixir-tools) is a collection of editor extensions, language servers, and tooling for productive Elixir development.

- [Next LS](https://github.com/elixir-tools/next-ls) - The language server for Elixir that _just_ works
- [elixir-tools.nvim](https://github.com/elixir-tools/elixir-tools.nvim) - Neovim Plugin for Elixir
- [elixir-tools.vscode](https://github.com/elixir-tools/elixir-tools.vscode) - VSCode Plugin for Elixir
- [Credo Language Server](https://github.com/elixir-tools/credo-langauge-server) - LSP implementation for Credo
- [GenLSP](https://github.com/elixir-tools/gen_lsp) - Language Server Protocol behaviour for Elixir
- [Tableau](https://github.com/elixir-tools/tableau) - Static Site Generator for Elixir

### Temple

[Temple](https://github.com/mhanberg/temple) is an HTML DSL for Elixir and Phoenix and my first original contribution to the Elixir community.

Inspired by the [Lucky web framework](https://luckyframework.org/guides/frontend/rendering-html#creating-a-page) templating language, Temple allows you to effortlessly author HTML without leaving the comfortable embrace of Elixir.

I learned a _lot_ about macros and metaprogramming while building Temple and found a lot of great resources along the way, including&#58;

* [Metaprogramming Elixir](https://amzn.to/2CVV7lr) by [Chris McCord](https://twitter.com/chris_mccord).
* [Understanding Elixir Macros](https://www.theerlangelist.com/article/macros_1) blog series by [Saša Jurić](https://twitter.com/sasajuric)

### Wallaby

[Wallaby](https://github.com/elixir-wallaby/wallaby) is an Elixir integration testing library that provides a pleasant functional interface.

After using Wallaby on a side project, the original creator ([Chris Keathley](https://keathley.io)) stepped down as the lead maintainer and asked the community if anyone could take ownership of the library.

Having never "seriously" contributed to an open source project before, I was nervous about responding to Keathley. So I started contributing [small PRs](https://github.com/elixir-wallaby/wallaby/pull/371) to learn the code base and it lead to being asked to become an official maintainer of the library.

Maintaining a popular open source library has presented me with new challenges in addition to programming and I truly appreciate every opportunity Wallaby has given me.

Thank you Chris!
