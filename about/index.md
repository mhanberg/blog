## Hi, I'm Mitchell Hanberg

I'm a software developer in Indianapolis, IN and I work for a software product design and development company called [Software Engineering Professionals](https://www.sep.com).

I am currently exploring, building, and writing about:
- Elixir and Phoenix
- React and JavaScript
- Building great products with effective teams.

### Podcast Appearances
