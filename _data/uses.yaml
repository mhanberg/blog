    My desktop computer (codename `nublar`) is my primary development machine for personal and open source projects.

    It runs Ubuntu and I configure it completely with Nix, but I am interested in switching to NixOS. I basically only use it remotely via ssh,
    in what I like to call "Darwin Subsystem for Linux."

    I have been using mechanical keyboards since 2012 and split ergonomic keyboards since 2019 (starting with the Ergodox EZ).

    I eventually got the ZSA Voyager in an attempt to try a smaller keyboard, but ended up ordering a Corne v4 from JLCPCB and
    3D printing its case and keycaps. I really am liking the low profile style of keyboards because they end up being shorter and
    I don't need to use a wrist rest.

    In 2024 I started to get into "home labbing", which basically just means having a NAS and a bunch of mini PCs.

    I deploy each mini PC with NixOS and orchestrate them with [colmena](https://github.com/zhaofengli/colmena). I think NixOS is a great operating
    system for a homelab (or remote servers in general) as it allows you to declaratively enable and configure programs, as well as
    easily let you create new systemd units or start containers as units.

    I have a Digital Ocean droplet running a Caddy server (via NixOS and colmena) as ingress, and they are all clustered together via [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/).
