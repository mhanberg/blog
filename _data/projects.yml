    Temple is an HTML DSL for Elixir and Phoenix and my first original contribution to the Elixir community.

    Inspired by the [Lucky web framework](https://luckyframework.org/guides/frontend/rendering-html#creating-a-page) templating language, Temple allows you to effortlessly author HTML without leaving the comfortable embrace of Elixir.

    I learned a _lot_ about macros and metaprogramming while building Temple and found a lot of great resources along the way, including&#58;

    Wallaby is an Elixir integration testing library that provides a pleasant functional interface.

    After using Wallaby on a side project, the original creator ([Chris Keathley](https://keathley.io)) stepped down as the lead maintainer and asked the community if anyone could take ownership of the library.

    Having never "seriously" contributed to an open source project before, I was nervous about responding to Keathley. So I started contributing [small PRs](https://github.com/elixir-wallaby/wallaby/pull/371) to learn the code base and it lead to being asked to become an official maintainer of the library.

    Maintaining a popular open source library has presented me with new challenges in addition to programming and I truly appreciate every opportunity Wallaby has given me.

    Thank you Keathley!
