It's the 3pm and you decide it's time for another coffee.

You get up from your desk, your back tensing as you straighten into full standing position.

As you walk to the coffee maker, you rub your eyes. They feel dry and it takes some effort to blink.

You reach the kitchen and look around the room. Why did you come in here again?

We've all been there. The back pain, the eye strain, and the brain drain.

You might say that these are the symptoms of a desk job and there is no way around it. I'm here to tell you that you're wrong!

I became interested in desktop ergonomics when I started using the text editor [Vim](https://www.vim.org) 2 years ago.

With Vim I can control everything in the editor with the keyboard and as my Vim skills improved, I became faster and faster at manipulating text. This speed increase was taking a toll on my wrists and forearms and I became fearful of developing [RSI](TODO).

Thinking of better ways to type lead me to thinking about all of the other ways I could improve my experience working at a desk. The resulting experiences are the foundation on which this article is based.

Now that we've expelled the notion that you can't improve your work habitat, let's get started.

## Principles

My experience has shown me that there are some guiding principles that can lead you to the optimal arrangement of your furniture, tools, and body.

I call these principles and not rules for a reason. My desktop arrangement works for me, but that doesn't mean that it will work for you. Everyone's responsibilities differ and there can't be a one size fits all solution.

Take a week to observe yourself working. Take notes and reflect on what is working for you and what doesn't.

Once you've discovered some areas for improvement, make adjustments incrementally. You want to know which thinks help and which things don't.

Rinse and repeat.

Sometimes positive adjustments will exaggerate another movement or position, making a new problem. It'll take some tweaking, but once you find something that works, you'll be set for life.

## Promote Positive Blood Circulation

Poor blood circulation can lead to numbness and pain in your extremities and is caused by a misconfigured chair and desk.

### Legs

When your **chair is too short**, your knees and pelvis are angled too sharply or upward, stopping blood from flowing down to your feet.

#### Solution

Your chair should be tall enough that your knees bend at an angle greater than 90ยบ and you should sit forward enough in your chair that you have some forward pelvic tilt.

Essentially, you should try to keep your body as straight as possible without falling off your chair.

TODO INSERT IMAGE OF CHAIR

If you have the resources, I would get a sit-stand desk. Specifically the kind with legs move, not the kind that sit on top of your desk.

[This](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/bekant-corner-desk-right-sit-stand-black-stained-ash-veneer-black-s79282389/) is the one I use. I try to stand in the mornings and in the late afternoon.

### Arms

When your **desk is too tall**, you will put pressure on your forearms on the edge of the desk. This restricts blood flow in addition to the fight against gravity, as your arms are angled upward.

#### Solution

1. Improve your posture by sitting straighter and further up on your chair. 
1. Increase the height of your chair.
1. Lowering your desk.

The goal is to have your arms facing downward and for your forearms to not touch the desk.

Having a sit-stand desk helps because you're able to move the desk to the exact height that you need.

### Hands

If you find that your wrists are bent upward to type on your keyboard, you'll notice your hands getting really cold and numb.

#### Solution

This can can be solved by getting a wrist rest, which elevates the surface of the desk to equal that of your keyboard. This simulates how it is to type on a laptop, where the keyboard is sunken into the "surface".

## Reduce Arm Movement

Moving your arms is slow and tiresome. The better you get at using your tools, the more you'll notice this.

### Mouse

If the keyboard is the primary input method you use, moving your hand to your mouse can seem to take forever.

We can help reduce this movement by placing the mouse closer to the alphanumeric keys (where our hands are located on the keyboard).

A standard full size keyboard consists of the alphanumeric keys, cursor keys (arrow keys, home, end, etc), and the numpad.

When you include the necessary space for your mouse to move around, there is between 9-12 inches of space between where your hands rest and the mouse!

We can reduce this distance by replacing your full size keyboard with a "Tenkeyless" keyboard. This is a keyboard that lacks the numpad (tenkey referring to the keys 0 through 9). This will reduce the travel distance to 6-9 inches.

Unless you work in the finance industry, there is a good chance that you never use the numpad anyway.

One step further is to get a "60%" keyboard. This type of keyboard consists of only the alphanumeric keys. You can access the cursor keys via a second "layer" using the `fn` key. This will further reduce the travel distance to 3-6 inches.

There is one final step to decreasing the movement distance, and that is to **get a trackball mouse**.

A trackball mouse remains stationary on the desk and does not require extra room to be used. It can stay tucked right next to the edge of your keyboard. The travel distance is 0 inches.
