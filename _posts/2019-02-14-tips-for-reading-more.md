In 2017, I challenged myself to read 20 books and I was able to read 22 books.

In 2018, I raised the bar to _30_ books, but I was only able to read 16.

In 2019, I'm still aiming for 30 books; how can I make this happen?

So far in 2019 I've already read 7 books and have found good strategies for frequent and consistent reading.

I've started **reading during boring activities that don't require my eyes**. I read in bed when I'm struggling to fall asleep. I read in the morning when I'm riding my stationary bike. This is similar to the idea of listening to a podcast while driving to work.

I've started **buying books in groups of three**. Always having something in the queue decreases the number of times that I have to figure out what I'm going to read next. 

I've started **asking my friends for book recommendations**. This decreases the risk of starting a bad book and relieves [decision paralysis](https://xkcd.com/1801/). I'll show the list of [books I want to read](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/69703261-mitchell?shelf=to-read) to a friend and ask if they recommend anything on the list, essentially cross referencing _my_ interests with _their_ recommendations.

I've started **sharing what I'm reading**. When I make my three-book purchase, I share a [screenshot on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mitchhanberg/status/1083199091646046208?s=20). This creates pseudo social pressure to finish and sharing it in the open helps solidify my [identity](https://jamesclear.com/identity-based-habits) as a "reader."
