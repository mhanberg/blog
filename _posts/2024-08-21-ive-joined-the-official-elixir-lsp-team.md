I've joined the official Elixir language server team!

This is the culmination of the efforts from [Jonatan Kłosko](https://github.com/jonatanklosko) (of LiveBook), [Steve Cohen](https://github.com/scohen) (of Lexical), [Łukasz Samson](https://github.com/lukaszsamson) (of ElixirLS), and myself ([Mitchell Hanberg](https://github.com/mhanberg) of Next LS). 

You can read more about it on [elixir-lang.org](https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2024/08/15/welcome-elixir-language-server-team/).

We are currently working on merging the three projects (Lexical, ElixirLS, and Next LS) into a single official project, so in the meantime, you can continue to use 
the language server you are currently using.

If you would like to support my efforts on this project, please sponsor me on GitHub! I have a goal of reaching 100 sponsors, and as of writing I'm a little more than halfway there.

If you sponsor and would like an elixir-tools sticker, please email me your name and address and I'll send one your way (even internationally!)
