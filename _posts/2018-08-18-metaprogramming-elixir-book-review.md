### Who is the target audience?

Advanced beginner to intermediate Elixir developers who have mastered the syntax and basic structure of Elixir applications who want to add advanced language features to their skill set.

### Review

Chris McCord (creator of the [Phoenix Framework](https://phoenixframework.org/)) introduces you to the power of macros with the Elixir programming language.

This book (a member of the [Pragmatic exPress](https://pragprog.com/pragmatic-express) series) is short and to the point. If you're reading this book, you probably are interested in the practical application of macros and metaprogramming, and this book delivers.

_Metaprogramming Elixir_ guides you through the basics of defining macros, but quickly dives into best practices and how you can use these techniques to improve your real life code. 

In addition to showing you when it's most appropriate to utilize a macro, Chris teaches you how to test macros and what aspects of metaprogramming are worth testing. As a practitioner of [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), I find this incredibly valuable.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will definitely be referencing it in the future.
