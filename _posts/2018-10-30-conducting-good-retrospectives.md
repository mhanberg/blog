Your team has probably experienced moments of success or failure, moments of working like a well-oiled-machine or not being able to stand the sound of each other's voice. What you've probably also done is pass these moments by without taking time to ponder "Why did these things happen"?

This is when your team holds a __retrospective__.

### What is a retrospective?

A retrospective (or "retro") is a recurring meeting used by teams to look back at the last week or two in order to figure out what went well and what went poorly. The realm of topics is wide ranging: from missing deadlines to mishandled social interactions. These meetings aren't just to make you feel good or bad about yourselves, they're designed to curate items on which your team will take action after the meeting.

Setting aside dedicated time for these matters assures that they will get some attention and helps keep these conversations from spilling into normal work time (this isn't to say that you shouldn't discuss something when it happens).

## How to conduct a retrospective

Anyone can host a retrospective, but holding a _good_ retrospective takes some finesse. There are four key aspects that I believe are paramount to a good retrospective: Facilitation, Conversational Turn Taking, Format/Activity, and Action Items.

#### Facilitation

Someone should volunteer to facilitate the meeting. This person will lead the chosen activity for the meeting. Depending on the activity, this can include: keeping a conversation timer, taking notes, or tracking whose turn it is to speak. 

Having a facilitator **isolates the responsibility of running the meeting to one person**, allowing everyone else to concentrate on participating.

#### Conversational Turn Taking

It's very important that everyone can be heard. Your team should decide on a signal that makes it clear you have something to say next. My team has opted to use a finger raise when you want to say something. Once the person currently speaking is done, they or the facilitator would motion to the next person in line to speak. 

Often one might have something to say that is tangential to the current conversation, and will delay their turn to speak to let the current thread of discussion finish.

The primary motivation for the technique to is **avoid interruptions** and **talking over each other**.

#### Format/Activity

Free form conversation is not conducive to reaching conclusions, so it helps to pick a meeting format that fits well with your team. At the beginning of the meeting, the facilitator will explain the format and confirm that everyone is okay with that decision. Different formats optimize for different aspects of your team: project performance, interpersonal communication, or general frustration.

Picking a format gives the **meeting structure** and often an **objective**, allowing the team to work together towards a known and common goal.

#### Action Items

A necessary output of the meeting is a list of action items. An action item is a task that requires further action in order to accomplish it and is assigned to a specific person. You've probably experienced the situation where everyone agrees something should get done, but no one ever does it.

Sometimes you run into an action item that isn't a specific task, but possibly a general change in behavior that is meant to be actioned by the whole team. In this case, the real action item would be the responsibility of shepherding the adoption of this new behavior for a couple weeks.

Leaving the meeting with a list of action items assures that the tasks you spent an hour finding, **actually get done**.

## Case Study

For the last year, my team has had a weekly retro, alternating the format each week. We operate in two week sprints, so in the middle of the sprint we typically concentrate on interpersonal or morale issues and at the end of the sprint we focus on project-specific issues.

However, at the beginning of any retrospective, we solicit the opportunity to suggest an alternate format.

#### Mid-Sprint Retrospective

During the Mid-Sprint Retrospective we engage in the [Lean-Coffee](http://leancoffee.org) activity (unless someone suggests an alternate activity!). The chosen facilitator will explain the chosen activity and pass out the required supplies. 

For Lean Coffee, we use sticky notes, sharpies, and a white board. 

The facilitator sets a timer for 4 or 5 minutes and we all generate conversation topics using the sticky notes and sharpies. Once the timer goes off, the facilitator solicits the opportunity for more time and then each person places their stickies up on the white board, giving a very brief description of the topic.

Once everyone has placed their topics on the board, the facilitator places on leftover topics from the previous Mid-Sprint Retro on the board, and let their respective authors describe them.

We then [dot vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-voting) the proposed topics, generally assigning everyone 3-4 votes depending on the number of topics. After which we discuss the topics according to the number of votes it received.

The facilitator will set a timer for 4-5 minutes and discussion will start. Once the five minutes are up, everyone will give a thumb up, down, or neutral (sideways) indicating whether they would like to continue discussing the topic.
