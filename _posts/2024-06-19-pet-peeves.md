Here's a list of minor things I find irritating.

- Calling software "dead" or "abandoned"
- Complaining about too many choices, especially when C=2
- Complaining about what other people are doing when it doesn't affect you at all
- Judgment without context
- Speaking in a way that implies you have a ton of experience with something (saying "I do this in all my apps") when really you've done it two times
- The word "just"
