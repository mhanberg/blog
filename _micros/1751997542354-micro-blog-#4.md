I was running into a super strange [Zig](https://ziglang.org) error locally on my desktop, but it wasn't happening in GitHub Actions.

Well, turns out that when I updated my desktop to Ubuntu 25.04, the Linux kernel updated to 6.14, which exceeds the max
supported version by Zig (6.13).

I'll probably take the full dive into NixOS now, as it'll have an older kernel, but you can set the kernel to whatever you
want ðŸ˜Ž.
