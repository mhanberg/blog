This weekend I finally took the plunge to switch from Ubuntu w/ Nix to full blown NixOS on my personal desktop.

Everything went very smoothly, except that I accidentally installed it on top of my Windows drive rather than over the Ubuntu drive ðŸ˜­.

A couple copy pastes to get the Nvidia drivers installed and it was golden. I was shocked that with the default GNOME worked well with my Apple trackpad, even the gestures work.

I'll still probably just SSH into it, but now it's nice to have everything inside Nix and not using Apt for a couple random things.
